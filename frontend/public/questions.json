          "explanation": "Individuals may have a misconception about various privacy tools that are usable in today’s society, which places them at a disadvantage when it comes to security and privacy. It is important to realize that limitations arise with what is protected from Tor Browser, VPNs, and Private Browsing: Private Browsing is wonderful because it protects against local browsing history and cookie storage but it isn't the case outside of your browser; especially since websites or your ISP can still track or see your activity. It also doesn’t provide protection from malware. VPNs or Virtual Private Networks is a tool that can encrypt your internet traffic and mask your IP address which is what websites are able to see. However, it is important to realize that VPNs don't inherently give full anonymity, especially because ISPs are still able to see your VPN connection but not the specific activity. Tor Browser is a browser that anonymizes a user’s web traffic by going through different ‘relays’ and is also great at masking your IP address, but it does not actually prevent all forms of tracking; especially when logging into an account nor does it provide protections outside the browser."
